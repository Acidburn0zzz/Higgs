* IDEAS
# stuff I'm thinking about
** all libs
 - cleaner API designs
 - start with simple, clean, and safe - fast later
 - come up with set of fundamental 'interfaces' and have libs follow them (iterators, streams, etc)
** lib/ffi
 - improve perf
 - keep improving error messages/checking
 - improved wrapping
 - wrapAll() function?
 - add some preprocessor functionality?
 - track down perf problems
 - generate type checking code for function calls?
** lib/console
 - make more configurable? i.e. how objects are formatted etc, separation ws, etc.
** lib/draw
 - some of this should be factored out into more general purpose libs
** higgs-mode
 - higgs-dev functionality - run make targets, etc flymake?
 - addons for js-mode and js2-mode to get correct syntax coloring, autocomplete, etc behavior for
   Higgs globals (such as require()) and IR function names, etc.
