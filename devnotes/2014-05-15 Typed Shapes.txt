ODO: study shape implementation in FF, look at slides, look at source

TODO: think about shapes more
- want a guaranteed minimum object size
  - no need for a special ext table, can use objects as is with len, next ptr
- how complicated would they be to implement in a basic form?
  - switch to shape idx
- how much simplification could you get on object property accesses?
  - sketch it out
- can use shape pointers directly
  - shapes can keep list of referring blocks
- start writing D code for shapes
  - class ObjShape
- no more "make_map"

TODO: Project Badger
- Does PyPy run the shootout tests
- Can we make them all run too?
- Aggressive PR, attract attention, responses will too
