TODO: study shape implementation in FF, look at slides, look at source
- ask about multiple successive transitions, constructors

TODO: think about shapes more
- guaranteed minimum object size
  - ext table for extra properties
- how complicated would they be to implement in a basic form?
  - switch to shape idx
- start writing D code for shapes
  - class ObjShape
- no more "make_map"
- getters/setters
- no more "missing" value?
- array elem prop

TODO: Project Badger
- Does PyPy run the shootout tests
- Can we make them all run too?
- Aggressive PR, attract attention, responses will too

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** Need to skech out implementation, runtime code ***
Think about shape representation and implementation in detail

Moz people use a tree, with many special cases
- Creation site not accounted for, properties added in order
- Operations make us transition to new shapes in a tree structure of shapes
- Operations
  - Write value of some given type to property k
  - set property attribs
  - install getter/setter
  - those could possibly all be special cases of write value?
    - maybe not, can set attribs without setting value?

Getters-setters:
- Fast access speed not necessarily critical
- Main goal is to eliminate overhead for normal property accesses
- Get/set doesn't have an index/offset into objects?
  - Probably still needs to be stored in there? Otherwise stored in the map

Probably want to move the proto lookup logic into some readProp instruction?
- Less logic in JS, generate more compact assembly
- Need to bail out of there is the property is a getter/setter
  - instr can return a closure ptr if this is the case?
